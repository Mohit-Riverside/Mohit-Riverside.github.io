    <h2>Making a simple robot!</h2>
    <div class="w3-justify">
      <p>Here's a detailed guide to help you create a basic robot using two DPDT (Double Pole Double Throw) switches, two motors, a battery, wheels, and a chassis made of sunboard (a type of foam board).</p>
      <h3>Materials Required</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Two DPDT switches</li>
        <li>Two DC motors</li>
        <li>One battery (suitable for the motors, e.g., 6V or 12V)</li>
        <li>Four wheels (preferably with hubs that fit the motors)</li>
        <li>2ftx2ft Sunboard</li>
        <li>Wires and connectors</li>
        <li>Double-sided tape or glue (for mounting)</li>
        <li>Soldering iron and solder (for connections)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps to Build the Robot</h3>
      <h4>1. <strong>Prepare the Chassis</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cut the Sunboard:</strong> Cut the sunboard into a rectangular or square shape to form the base of your robot. The size should be enough to fit your motors and battery comfortably.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mount the Motors:</strong> Position the motors on the chassis where you want them to be. If the motors have mounting holes, use screws to attach them. If not, you can use double-sided tape or glue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attach the Wheels:</strong> Fix the wheels to the motor shafts. Ensure they are securely attached and can rotate freely.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>2. <strong>Wire the Motors to the DPDT Switches</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand the DPDT Switch:</strong> A DPDT switch can control the direction of the current to the motors, allowing them to move forward or backward. It has six terminals: two for each direction and two common terminals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wire the Motors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motor A:</strong> Connect two terminals of the DPDT switch to the two terminals of Motor A. This will allow you to control the direction of Motor A.</li>
<li><strong>Motor B:</strong> Connect the other two terminals of the second DPDT switch to the terminals of Motor B.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connect the Switches to the Battery:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common Terminals:</strong> Connect the common terminals of each DPDT switch to the positive and negative terminals of the battery. Make sure to do this carefully to avoid short circuits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wiring Diagram:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motor A Wiring:</strong> Connect one pair of terminals on the DPDT switch to the two terminals of Motor A. Connect the remaining pair of terminals to the battery (positive to positive and negative to negative).</li>
<li><strong>Motor B Wiring:</strong> Follow the same steps for Motor B with the second DPDT switch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify Connections:</strong> Ensure all connections are secure and insulated properly. You might need to use a soldering iron to make solid connections if using wire connectors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>3. <strong>Test the Robot</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Power On:</strong> Insert the battery into the circuit. Make sure the battery is charged and correctly connected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operate the Switches:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forward:</strong> When you move the DPDT switches in one direction, both motors should rotate in the forward direction.</li>
<li><strong>Backward:</strong> When you switch the direction of the DPDT switches, the motors should rotate in the reverse direction.</li>
<li><strong>Stop:</strong> Centering the DPDT switch should stop the motors, or they may not rotate if the switches are not in the correct position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjust if Necessary:</strong> If the robot doesn&rsquo;t move as expected, double-check your wiring and ensure that the switches are correctly oriented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>4. <strong>Finalize the Build</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Components:</strong> Once everything is working, use double-sided tape, glue, or additional screws to secure all components (motors, battery, switches) to the chassis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Test and Adjust:</strong> Perform a final test to make sure the robot moves smoothly in all directions. Make any necessary adjustments to the alignment of the wheels or the wiring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safety Check:</strong> Ensure that there are no exposed wires or loose connections that could cause short circuits or damage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! You've successfully built a simple robot. This basic setup gives you control over the movement and direction of your robot using the DPDT switches.</p>
